          Hi, I'm Giordan, a software developer with a background in Computer
          Engineering and a passion for building digital experiences that
          connect people.

        <p className="text-grey-700 leading-relaxed">
          My journey into tech started with curiosity â€” tinkering with code,
          experimenting with web design, and pushing myself to turn ideas into
          something tangible. Over the years, I've worked with startups, media
          companies, and freelance clients, all of which shaped the way I
          approach development: not just as code, but as a tool for solving real
          problems.
